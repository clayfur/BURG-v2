# BURG V2

![Clip of demo](Clips/BURG_clip.gif)

This is a protoype hand tracking based demo made for a project presentation used during my final year capstone review.

## Description

This project is served as the research demonstraction for implementing hand tracking based interactions for the main multiplayer game.

The demo was made under heavy time constraints and so utilises script machines to control the logic within the game.

It is still a work in progress and I will continue to update the script machine logic used in the game with better and more functional C# code.
